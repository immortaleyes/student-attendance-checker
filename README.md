## 🚀 Why This Matters

In many academic institutions, students **must maintain at least 75% attendance** to avoid being debarred from exams. But often, they realize their attendance is insufficient **too late**. This system empowers:

- **Students** — by tracking real-time attendance and warnings  
- **Teachers/Admins** — by reducing manual record-keeping  
- **Institutions** — by increasing transparency and academic success

## 📊 Predictive Debarment Logic

The app calculates the percentage of attended vs. total classes and labels students:

- 🟢 **SAFE** – Above 75%
- 🟡 **WARNING** – Between 60% and 75%
- 🔴 **CRITICAL** – Below 60%

The system even tells students **how many more classes** they need to attend to get back on track!
